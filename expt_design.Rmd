## Experimental design
### Introduction
You will often collect data where you have more than one explanatory variable,
and there are two particular areas where this might arise:

* Designed experiments
* Surveys or 'natural' experiments

**Designed experiments** are typically laboratory studies where you have
considerable control over the structure of the study, the number of replicates,
the different treatment(s) used etc. Designed experiments can also be plot-
based agricultural experiments, or animal behaviour experiments.

**Natural experiments** may arise where you want to study species distributions,
ecological characteristics or wildlife patterns in as natural and un-modified
situation as possible. This of course results in you having less ability to
decide what variables to include, because there may be numerous factors in the
environment that are affecting the species you are studying.

## The value of randomisation
The simplest type of experimental design includes some sort of randomisation, and
can be used in both laboratory- and field-experiments. Randomisation is useful for
both 'designed' and 'natural' experiments. The need for multiple replicates may
seem fairly obvious to you, but think about one of the world's oldest agricultural
experiments, the Palace Leas Experiment at Cockle Park.

![](www/palace_leas_photo.png)

The siteslopes gently down a hill away from the farm lane, down towards a stream, with a series of 14 roughly rectangular shaped plots receiving different treatments:

![](www/palace_leas_plot_layout.png)

Some treatments are replicated (for different years in the rotation cycle
for treatments) but not all of them are replicated. In fact, standard theories on
good practice for experimental design had not been developed when the Palace Leas
experiment was started. Since the start of the experiment, changes to sampling
methods have eased some problems, by dividing each long rectangle into 4 sub-units
for sampling, but there remain some problems, and advanced statistical methods
are sometimes needed.


```{r palace_leas, echo=FALSE}
question("What do you think are some of the challenges that arise from the original
         design? (select ALL that apply)",
  answer("There may be an effect from being near the road", correct = TRUE),
  answer("There is no replication"),
  answer("Plots near the stream may be wetter", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Multiple samples cannot be taken within a plot"),
  answer("Samples within a plot might not be independent", correct =TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## Ways to randomise your treatments
### Fully randomised design
There are several methods of creating multiple replicates of your experimental 
units and randomising the allocation of treatments to them. To give you some
examples:

1. You might want to investigate the effect of a new antibiotic on bacterial growth.

![](www/bacteria_on_petri.jpeg)
     
   + Your **experimental units** could be Petri-dishes on which you grow bacteria.
   + Your **response variable** is bacterial growth
   + Your **explanatory variable** has is a categorical 'factor': no antibiotic, your new antibiotic

2. You are interested in the effects of _Rhinanthus minor_ on species diversity
in grasslands. _Rhinanthus_ is a parasite of grasses, and therefore reduces their
vigour. This allows other species of wildflower to colonise the grassland.
![](www/rhinanthus_minor.jpeg)
     + Your **experimental units** could be different plots in a meadow, each 10 x 10 m
     + Your **response variable** is the overall diversity of wildflowers
     + Your **explanatory variable** is a factor with two categories: a control, and plots with
_Rhinanthus_ seed growing

You can probably think of other studies where you have explanatory variables with
3, 4 or more categorical levels in them.

You decide to create a simple fully randomised design experiment, with 5 replicates
for each of your two treatments. So for the antibiotic experiment, you have 5 Petri
dishes without antibiotic (control), and 5 with your new antibiotic, and you put
these onto a plastic tray in the incubator.  For the _Rhinanthus_ experiment you
have 5 plots in your field without any _Rhinanthus_ seed added (control), and 5
with the seed. You toss a coin to allocate treatments to Petri dishes or plots,
and end up with the following design.

![](www/fully_randomised.png)

```{r fully_randomised, echo=FALSE}
question("What do you think is the problem with this design; A is your control
         (no antibiotic, or no Rhinanthus) and B treatment (antibiotic or 
         Rhinanthus)",
  answer("There are not enough replicates", message = "Although replication is
         low, it might be sufficient, especially if you have done pilot studies"),
  answer("There are only two treatment levels in the explanatory variable. You 
         need at least three, e.g. different concentrations of antibiotic, or
         different seed sowing rates", message = "Only 2 levels in your explanatory
         variable is sufficient"),
  answer("Most of the control Petri-dishes or plots are at one end of the tray
         or field respectively", correct = TRUE, message = "Good. This may bias
         your results"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
  )
```

Think back to the Palace Leas experiment, which was on a slope. Even if it had
originally been created as a fully randomised experiment, it would not be ideal
if most of the plots for one of the fertiliser treatments plots had ended up,
purely by chance, by the road or by the stream. Likewise, temperatures in an
incubator are less stable near the door than at the back of an incubator. If most
of your Petri-dishes for the antibiotic were, purely by chance, near the door
then that might bias your results.

Of course you could eventually get round this problem by greatly increasing the
number of replicates. But that would be expensive and time-consuming. Instead
you can slightly change how you set up your experiment, so that it is more robust,
yet use no more resources.

## Blocking
### Introduction
Sub-dividing your experimental 'space' into 'blocks' can often improve the power
of your experiments, without the need for any additional time, replicates or
resources. Take a look at the following diagram, which represents the same
experiment as before, i.e. the units are Petri dishes arranged on an incubator
tray with/without antibiotic, or field plots with/without _Rhinanthus_ seed.

![](www/randomised_block.png)

The experiment is now arranged as having 5 'blocks' from left-to-right. Within
each block there are 2 replicates for each treatment, but their arrangement
within these blocks is completely random.

### How does blocking help?
Imagine the left-hand side of the grid in the diagram above is next to the door
of the incubator, or farm track in the field experiment. Hopefully you can see
both treatments occur close to the door, or farm track, and both treatments are
also preset at the back of the incubator or a long way from the farm-track at
the right-hand side of the grid. This didn't happen in the earlier fully
randomised design, so is an immediate improvement.

This improved design also increases your ability to detect whether your treatments
are actually doing anything. In a linear model, your overall pattern is:

$$\text{Response} = \text{Explanatory variable} + Error$$
where in these examples you have

$$\text{Response} = \text{Explanatory variable} + Error$$
where the $Error$ is the unknown variation or 'noise' in your data. In these 2
examples you have
$$\text{Bacterial growth} = \text{control/antibiotic} + Error$$
and
$$\text{Wildflower diversity} = \text{control/Rhinanthus} + Error$$
Remember that you have two columns, one with your response variable, and one with
your explanatory variable, with each row of the latter categorised into which 
treatment 'level' is applied.

The overall importance of your explanatory variable is determined by the amount
of variation it explains relative to the amount of unknown $Error$ variation. Recall
that the F-value in an ANOVA table is based on the ratio of mean squares (variances)
in your explanatory variable : error. 

**Key points** arising from this are:

* If the $Error$ is large it is going to be harder to detect an effect from your
explanatory variable
* The $Error$ might be increased due to changes across your experimental units,
for example whether your Petri dishes are near the incubator door, or your field
plots are near the road
* If you explicitly account for this systematic variation across your experiment,
you can **reduce** the $Error$ and **increase** your ability to detect an effect
from your explanatory variables.

So, you can replace your original linear model:

$$\text{Response} = \text{Explanatory variable} + Error$$
with this one:

$$\text{Response} = \text{Explanatory variable} + \text{Block} + Error$$
In the second linear model the $Error$ will be smaller, as some of the variation
is accounted for by Block. As a result, you are more likely to find an effect
from the explanatory variable.


## Worked example of randomised blocks
Here is a simple experiment to investigate the effects of nitrogen (N) and
phosphorous (P) on plant biomass. There are four blocks, and also an untreated
control. The following exercise contains the results in a data.frame called
`plant_growth`, read in as a 4 row (blocks) by 4 column (block, control, N, P).
Create a boxplot showing the differences in biomass according to treatment and summarise these data.

**Hints**:

* re-arrange the data so that they are in a 3 column table called `plant_growth_lng`
using the `pivot_longer()` function.
* Use the `gf_boxplot()` function to create the plot.
* use the `summary()` function.

```{r biomass_boxplot-setup}
# Avoid confusing with other data.frames
rm(lolium)
rm(plasma)
```

```{r biomass_boxplot, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r biomass_boxplot-solution}
plant_growth_lng <- pivot_longer(plant_growth,
                                 cols = Control:P,
                                 names_to = "fertiliser",
                                 values_to = "biomass")

gf_boxplot(biomass ~ fertiliser, data=plant_growth_lng)

summary(plant_growth_lng)
```


```{r coding_of_blocks, echo=FALSE}
question("What additional change is needed before you can analyse the data with
         a linear model?",
  answer("The blocks need to be recoded A to D", message = "Not essential, although
         if they had originally been coded as A to D rather than 1 to 4 this extra
         step would not be needed"),
  answer("The biomass values need to have units", message = "R can undertake the
         calculations without the need for units, but when displayed in a graph
         it is good practice to show the units"),
  answer("The rows need to be re-ordered to match their arrangement in the
         field", message = "No, you would only need to do this if you had large
         amounts of data and wanted to do a very complex spatial analysis."),
  answer("The summary() function gave min,mean,max values for the blocks. This
         suggests they are not being read by R as categorical", correct = TRUE,
         message = "R has interpreted the blocks as a continuous explanatory
         variable, whereas it should be categorical."),
  allow_retry = TRUE
  )
```

In the following exercise do the following with the `plant_growth_lng` dataset:

* recode the `block` variable to be categorical. **Hint**: use `as.factor()` function;
Use the `summary()` function to check the difference
* create a linear model `plant_growth_lm1` with only fertiliser as the explanatory
variable
* create a linear model `plant_growth_lm2` with both fertiliser and block as
explanatory variables
* compare the Anova tables for each model

```{r biomass_lm_setup}
plant_growth_lng <- pivot_longer(plant_growth,
                                 cols = Control:P,
                                 names_to = "fertiliser",
                                 values_to = "biomass")
rm(plant_growth)
rm(lolium)
rm(plasma)
```
```{r biomass_lm, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "biomass_lm_setup"}

```
```{r biomass_lm-solution}
# summary() function shows R mis-interprets block as continuous
summary(plant_growth_lng)

# Use the as.factor() function to ensure R recognises block as categorical
plant_growth_lng$block <- as.factor(plant_growth_lng$block)
summary(plant_growth_lng)

# Create your two linear models
plant_growth_lm1 <- lm(biomass ~ fertiliser, data=plant_growth_lng)
plant_growth_lm2 <- lm(biomass ~ fertiliser + block, data=plant_growth_lng)

# Check their ANOVA tables
Anova(plant_growth_lm1)
Anova(plant_growth_lm2)
```

Look at the output from the two `summary()` functions (use the Solution button
if you get stuck) and note how R codes the blocks correctly after using `as.factor()`.
The `$` symbol allows you to reference an individual column by name in R.

Study the two ANOVA tables.
```{r compare_anova_tables, echo=FALSE}
question("Which of the following statements about the ANOVA tables are true? (select ALL that apply)",
  answer("The variance for fertiliser is the same in both tables", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The residual sums of squares in the first ANOVA = the residual SS + 
         block SS in the second ANOVA", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The total degrees of freedom in both tables is the same", correct = TRUE),
  answer("There is a significant change in the biomass depending on the position
         in the field where the experiment is undertaken", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The F-value is higher for the fertiliser treatment when blocks are used
         because the residual variance is smaller", correct =TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Other examples of where blocks might be used
There are lots of other ways in which you can use blocks to improve your experiment
Examples might include:

* Birds might be blocked according to initial size, or initial egg batch, or
laying date
* Nesting sites might be blocked according to distance from urban areas or the edge of an island
* Growing marcoalgae in an aquarium might be blocked according to light intensity if this varies or position of water inflow.

Some of these 'blocking' variables are on continuous scales, such as distance
or light intensity. You can sub-divide a continuous scale into discrete categories
to help you block experiments if you want to eliminate that variable from your
experiment.

It is possible to block with 2 (or more) variables to get rid of the effect of
multiple unwanted variables. These are referred to as _Latin square_ designs
for 2 variables, or _Latin hypercubes_ when there are lots of variables. Given
the Star Trek/Star Wars name of the latter, you'll be glad we won't go into them
in this module.

## Summary
Think about ways in which you can use block designs to improve your experiments,
rather than always using a fully-randomised design. If you are an ecologist or
zoologist working in the field, these block designs can be harder to construct,
but solutions include blocking by site, type of habitat etc. If you are able to
block your design your can reduce the amount of unexplained noise, making it
easier to detect treatment effects.
